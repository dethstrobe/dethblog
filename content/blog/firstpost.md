First post setting up the blog.

It's powered by Eleventy because I didn't need a non-static website, and I know enough about coding that using markdown instead of something like wordpress sounded cool to me.

I'm not quite clear what I'm going to make of this site just yet. Maybe musing on agile software development, all the little random non-sense things I've learned in my time in the tech space, maybe just random things that interest me, or maybe just a place to talk about myself and my journey on how I got here.

I think it'd be kind of cool to make a slight game out of this site, but I'm not clear what that'd be. I guess it could also be a demo site and a place to host all my little front end experiments over the years.

Anyway, hopefully I got a bit more time to figure what to do this.
