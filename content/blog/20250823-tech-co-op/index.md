Having worked in the tech industry for a while now, I'm convinced there must be something better than the corporate hustle and grind. So let’s talk about an alternative approach, away from futile corporate overlords and maybe a move towards a collective anarchist commune.

## The Problem with Payouts
Why do tech workers get paid so well? Because we produce an absurd amount of value and software is basically infinitely reproducible at–relatively speaking–zero cost. This of course has led to companies that want the best talent offering them top dollar which has become a kind of badge of honor by my fellow engineers.

And, in my biased opinion we should be well compensated, but here enters a problem. If we’re building all this value and tech is basically responsible for keeping the US economy growing like it is, why are we not compensated even better and why don’t we have better job security?

In theory we are compensated so well because we're an extremely smart workforce. Yet decision making is disproportionately captured by a small group of stakeholders. Stakeholders who are so removed from the problem space that they can’t possibly be able to make well informed decisions about the work. Then they are disproportionately compensated for outcomes that they–arguably–didn’t contribute to. Why are we not treated as partners in the value creation proposition? Being closer to the metal gives engineers an eye on the problem and domain space that people higher up on the food chain just lack the context. We are more than just highly valued cogs in the machine. We are domain experts that can inform the direction of the product to mitigate risk and maximize value.

I don’t want to oversell the engineer’s contribution to making a successful product, because I do think it is extremely important that a teamwork game requires teamwork. So we should also acknowledge the other roles that do help build software. Like, Product Management is there to give voice to the user of the software. While Design is there to make sure the product is aesthetically pleasing and easily understood. All of these parts work together to make a better product.

While having a visionary auteur can create amazing works of art (and on occasions software). It is very difficult to find such visionaries that are really capable of possessing the deep, wide-ranging expertise required to make every critical decision, from the grandest idea to the smallest detail. And while I understand design by committee is a special place in hell, however, leveraging a team’s knowledge and expertise to help inform the product does usually create a better product.

## End to Fiefdoms
I never understood the idea of wanting to silo knowledge. I personally hate being the sole point of contact for anything. Don’t get me wrong, I love helping people. But you know, I wouldn’t want to be guilted into never taking a vacation because I’ve hoarded all the knowledge.

I also don’t believe in rockstar developers. I’ve actually met a few, and the ones I’ve met are good people that are able to pick up code bases from smell alone (exaggeration, they're just very intuitive). But I’ve also heard anecdotes about rockstar devs that have problematic personalities that get a pass from management because they're considered too valuable to the company. So they become a [missing stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair) and people just have to walk around them.

But why should anyone have to put up with that? You shouldn’t have to put up with toxic people because they "keep the lights on." Anyone can write code, but the only thing that makes a rockstar invaluable is the context no one else has. That’s why we need to break down knowledge silos, to ensure a person's value isn't tied to being the only one with domain-specific knowledge.

No one should have to put up with toxic coworkers. And even outside of just that, everyone should be able to take vacation. Being the sole contact for niche systems is too much for one person. No one person should be the load-bearing wall of an entire company.

## Die a Hero
The industry expects heroics. But heroes die and don’t even get to be martyrs. It just leads to burn out and wastes talent. This shouldn’t be normal. Heaven forbid we have sustainable work. Hyper growth at all cost does come at a human cost, which inevitably leads to burn out and leads to software entropy.

What do I mean by that? Working 80+ hour weeks. Working weekends. Never taking vacations because software needs to be shipped. Arbitrary deadlines. Gaps in processes that no one else can or wants to work on. Teams not communicating with each other. Being handed someone else’s code base that has no documentation and is the embodiment of spaghetti code. Never refactoring to improve a code base. Leaving dependencies to languish until there is a security vulnerability that requires an upgrade, but there are so many breaking changes that the upgrade becomes pure unadulterated madness. Random one off logic that violates the source of truth, making it near impossible to find where this is happening. Build processes that take hours to see if your change actually fixed a bug, because there is no way to unit test it. Fixing a bug in production and bypassing the dev environment. And there is just so much more…  

We don’t need heroics to ship software. We can actually distribute the burden. Call me crazy, but we don’t need rockstars that single handedly create amazing software. Instead we level everyone up to be just as good as the rockstar and spread context and decision making with XP practices.

Like Steve Jobs said, “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.”

There are no rockstar developers, because we all are capable of being rockstars. We don’t need to martyr developers to release software, because we can all bear the burden to ship software. There is nothing special about big tech. Everything they can do, anyone can do.

## Craftsmanship
With the rise of AI generated code, we’re putting out more slop that will lead to poorly maintained code bases that it becomes even harder to understand and becomes even harder to work on. The idea of software on-demand (the idea of generating software by LLM as you need it, not to be confused with SaaS) is moderately intriguing but I think I’d like my calculators and bank accounts to be a bit more deterministic, so I don’t think we can really rely purely on the vibes to do anything that requires a definitive source of truth.

And from my personal experience the best way to improve and maintain the craft of software engineering has been through eXtreme Programming. I’m not entirely discounting AI as a force multiplier on productivity, but I don’t think it’ll come from writing code, but instead as a tool to quickly look up documentation and handling repetitive tasks. So the idea of focusing and improving the human skill I still think will be more valuable than cutting humans out of the coding loop.

From my own personal anecdotal experience of trying to code with AI, it is overly zealous at giving you a working solution that misses very obvious edge cases. That said, it is a force multiplier on looking up documentation (unless you’re working with a library that is too new for it to have been trained on) or giving quick possible alternatives that I may not have thought about. And I do believe not only will humans still create better, more reliable, and safer code, but for continued maintenance of software systems, it is important that humans are able to understand the code. After all, when something goes wrong, AI isn’t going to be able to fix incomprehensible code base that itself generated. So the idea of cutting humans out of the loop and going towards entirely software on demand seems short sighted to me. Instead we should be investing in human skills.

I personally am making the bet that humans will continue for the foreseeable future to write better code than generative LLM. And AGI, Super Intelligence and the singularity aren’t years away but instead are decades away. The last mile problem, the same thing that prevents self-driving cars from taking over the roads, is also the same problem that will prevent LLMs from taking software jobs.

## Transparency and Trust
Organizations seem to often “us vs them.” So what if we kill that. One of the reasons I believe in XP is because I do actually trust that people can self organize to solve problems and are intelligent enough to make the best decision they can with what context they have. And if it is wrong, we pivot and course correct as soon as possible.

Developers should be able to help influence business goals and priorities. Decision making should not be edicts from above but instead be a collaboration. Give people the benefit of a doubt that we hired them because they’re smart and able to make well informed decisions given all the context as leadership.

Which also gets to the solution. A flat org. No gods or kings. Only man (like mankind, not to exclude women or anything).

## The Solution
To address all these problems that I see, I think what I’d like to do is to create a tech co-op. A company owned by the employees. Because it is owned and operated by the employees in a more fair and equitable way it means the co-op can focus on sustainability and not hyper growth.

XP can solve knowledge silos and level up devs to be all the same level of rockstar.

A flat org combats fiefdoms.

Most decisions should be pushed down to the team level, but in the case a larger disagreement occurs and a tiebreaker is necessary or maybe a decision that affects the organization itself, there will be a benevolent dictator model where the current CEO/General Manager will make the decision.

To also help enforce the benevolent dictator and conform with XP practices, the CEO position will be paired on and rotated. The CEO position would be a one-year rotation, with one of the two paired leads rotating every six months.

Compensation will be a formula. So everyone will know what everyone else is making. The co-op's finances will also be reported yearly offering full transparency on the finance of the co-op and where we are making investments.

Yearly pitch new ideas contest and vote by employees to help propose and shape the direction of the co-op. Followed by a lean startup to test the viability of the pitch for a few months where it will be measured and validated to see if the co-op should invest more into it, or pivot it, or just kill it and move on.

### Knowledge is Power
One of the reasons that I personally love XP is the hands-on mentorship you get while working. If you want to know how I see XP working, you can check out this article I wrote.

So I’m thinking, pair on everything. Not just programming, but also even product management, and design. And take it even further with sales, marketing, leadership, operations & infrastructure, security, data science, customer support, finance, and people operations, and legal (with some caveats). And not only do we pair, but we also rotate members between these roles to make more well balanced employees that have a systemic view of the company and the problems to bring new insights and solutions.

The more teams a member is on, and the more roles a member has participated on, the more valuable they are to the co-op and in turn they are compensated more for it.

### No negotiations, only transparency
How infuriating is it that you have the same role, tenure, and responsibilities as a peer but they make more money than you, because they negotiated better than you did. What if we didn’t have to be used car salesmen when accepting a job offer? What if a company was transparent about what everyone makes, and raises was a formula that you can plug your experience into and understand what you’ll be making in 5 or 10 years from now?

There is a history of systemic pay inequity and a lack of fairness in compensation in the industry. The current opaque negotiation system disproportionately disadvantages minority groups, women, and those lacking the social capital or experience to effectively haggle.

So to combat this problem, I’m going to give everyone, regardless of role, the same base salary. From there, raises will be based on years of tenure, number of roles in the team (this way we can train employees to be able to be engineers, designers, and product management), and number of teams you’ve worked on (employees will be encouraged to rotate between teams at least once a year). Because compensation is tied to making an employee more skilled and knowledgeable about various domains and on top of that more empathetic to other roles, employees should be compensated for it. We are all stronger together and thus compensation should match a more flexible employee that is able to do more.

### In Office
Controversial hot take, but I do think there is a lot of benefit with in-person collaboration. I do admit that online tools have made remote work much better than where it used to be. But I still believe that there is context and knowledge sharing that is just much easier when done in person.

It’s easier to get context when you are able to overhear watercooler conversations. Easier to have ad-hoc conversations when you can just walk up to a person and ask for their opinion. And recurring team building activities.

### A Healthy Workforce is a More Productive Workforce
Staying healthy is important. Not only are healthy employees going to be more resilient, happier, and more productive. Less sick days. Less medical bills. Better sleep. Better mood regulation. Better mental health. All this makes for a better company and working environment.

So how do we keep the workforce healthy? We build exercise into the workday. Every employee gets one hour during business hours for physical activity - running, cycling, weight training, yoga, calisthenics, whatever works for them. This isn't optional time off - it's part of the job, because a healthy workforce is a more productive workforce.

## Proof of Concept
I can hear all the tech bros now. "Ho ho ho, all these pretty idealistic words from some naive young engineer (I'm 41 as of writing). Sure, these communist ideals sound good on paper, but it'll never work in the real world."

Guess what! I'm not that original. Tech co-ops have been tried in the past and turns out can be successful. There is a community-maintained list of co-ops at [tech-coop.xyz](https://tech-coops.xyz/). These aren't struggling idealistic experiments - they're profitable, sustainable businesses that have found a better way to organize.

And here is a highlight of just a few:

### [Online Computer Library Centre](https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html)
An American nonprofit co-op that categorizes books. The founder, Frederick Kilgour, described it as, "merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library."

### [CoLab](https://colab.coop/)
Another American co-op that started in Ithaca, New York. They use technology to create and support social, economic, and environmental justice.

### [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/)
Started in Wellington, New Zealand as a response to the [Occupy Wellington movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_protests_in_New_Zealand). They create remote collaborative and consensus software.

## Tech Co-op: The Next Generation of Big Tech
The dystopian cyberpunk future isn't just approaching, we're already living in its early stages of late stage capitalism attempting to [enshittify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) our lives. But all hope is not lost. We do have the tools to reclaim power from the corporate overlords that seek to control our lives through the screen. We can eat the rich by siphoning money away from them to the rest of us by simply building what they organizationally cannot do.

I think a tech co-op is exactly what's needed to combat the stagnation of Big Tech. While they once championed being different from traditional large corporations, they have really turned into what they claim not to be.

The ideal naivety of early tech, taking a moral high ground, is easy to believe when you see hypergrowth in an emergent market. But once market expectations start to apply a bit of pressure, it's surprising how quick those moral ideals are compromised.

I still believe in those ideals. I still think tech can be a force for good in this world and not just a reason for big money to turn its money into more money. We can hold to those ideals if we distribute the decision-making and empower every member, so that it doesn't become the conviction of a few to hold the moral line. Through practices like transparent pay, a flat organization, and collective ownership, we can build a more sustainable and equitable future. That is why I believe a tech co-op is the solution.

Big Tech isn’t going to save us. We have to save ourselves. That’s why I want to build a co-op. And if you’re tired of waiting for a better future, you should too.
